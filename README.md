# Off-Platform Project: Fotomatic

## Project Goals
In this Codecademy project, I was tasked to fix a broken version of a responsive website called Fotomatic. 
I was provided with specs to help guide me in making adjustments to the broken code. 
To get started, I downloaded the broken code and the design specs, and also had access to a working version of the final product for reference.

## Description
This project was quite challenging, mainly because most of the code was already written out - I had to figure out what needed to be added or removed so that it would become responsive. 
Though I had access to the design specs and a 'working version' of the webpage I find it more difficult having to decipher and alter the existing code as opposed to starting from scratch since it helps to know exactly where everything is. 
I was able to accomplish this project, but it definitely took a lot longer to complete than most projects I've worked on while being in Codecademy. 

## Project Requirements
1. Follow the [design specs](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/full-stack-career-journey/Fotomatic/fotomatic_spec_landing_v2.png).
2. Make the webpage responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
3. Use 'rem' units.
